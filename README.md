# Books Search App (using Google Books API)

## App Description
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- The objective of this App is to use Google Books API (https://developers.google.com/books/docs/overview#books_api_v1) to query/search for books and display results with the following information:
    - Book's author
    - Title
    - Publishing Company
    - Picture of the Book    
    - External link pointing to additional info

## App Plan and Steps
- Setup React Front End using create-react-app
- Connect Google Books API - fetch request to obtain data
- Add conditionals to check for valid data, including no search results.
- Deploy to Heroku
